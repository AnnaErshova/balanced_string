Task: for a given string that contains a certain number of '(' and ')': 

* Find whether said string is balanced -- i.e. each '(' has a corresponding ')'. 
* A string can have alphanumeric characters other than '(' and ')'. 
* Return true and false.

* A string with no '('' or '(' and containing only alphanumeric characters will be considered balanced.
* An empty string will also be considered balanced

* A string where the first opening parenthesis is ')' or the last one is '(' should return 'invalid' instead.
