Task: for a given string that contains a certain number of '(' and ')', find whether said string is balanced -- i.e. each '(' has a corresponding ')'. Return true and false.

A string can have alphanumeric characters other than '(' and ')'. For the purposes of this exercise, a string with no '('' or '(' and containing only alphanumeric characters will be considered balanced.

A string where the first opening parenthesis is ')' or the last one is '(' should be considered invalid instead.
